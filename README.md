I wanted to learn about Restful API's and how they work. I built this API using node.js and mongodb. It is being hosted on heroku at 
<a href="https://my-first-api-winstonriggs.herokuapp.com/">https://my-first-api-winstonriggs.herokuapp.com/</a>


## Lessons Learned

I've learned how to connect to a database securely, build api endpoints, and use mongoose with node.js. This project also helped gain a deeper understanding in the inner workings of API's and how they work.
