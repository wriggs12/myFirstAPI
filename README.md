I wanted to learn machine learning so I decided to learn by doing. 
Currently adding new models from scratch as I learn about them. 
I've implemented KNN, KMeans, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes 
Models.


## Lessons Learned

I've learned that machine learning is mostly formatting and 
standardizing the data and optimizing models rather than building 
the models. I'd probabaly never build my own model from 
scratch in the future as I can easily import it from a library.

I've been able to fully understand the workings of several machine learning
models and I am continuing to furthur my understanding of machine learning.
